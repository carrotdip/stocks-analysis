# 2017-2018 Stocks Analysis
## Overview
### The process of this analysis was to analyze the annual return for 12 different stocks to allow Steve to create informed decisions on choosing which ones to invest in. To do this, the total daily volume as well as the starting and ending values were determined. Subsequently, the annual return was calculated. To make it visually appealing and easier to distinguish, the return cells were set to the color red for negative returns and green for positive returns. With this analysis, Steve can make versed decisions on which particular stocks to invest in.
## Results
### The total daily volume was calculated by using a nested for loop to add up all the daily volumes for each unique ticker.
